# Spruce-Voltmeter
Arduino Project With Borrowed Ideas for Wilderness Data

Based on a project by Shahariar @ https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/PSoC_Rocks/arduino-negative-voltmeter-993902

Goal is to go into the Alaskan Wilderness and listen to Spruce trees, and borrow their electrons.

Needs:
* Integration of SD card function to save datapoint
* sample rate for voltmeter
* some fine ASCII art
* aref_ voltage measure on board w/ battery power

## Notes on Spruce electrophysiology:

From [Love et al. 2008](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002963&type=printable):
>Here we postulate a simpler hypothesis: the sustained voltage difference routinely observed between parts of trees and soil is mainly due to a difference in pH between the two. Specifically, the tree-root-soil system acts as a concentration pH cell, sometimes actively maintained by the treeâ€™s homeostasis mechanisms. The potential from such a concentration cell is the Nernst potential, which only depends on a concentration gradient. At equilibrium (no net ionic flux across the interface), the Nernst potential is equal to the diffusion potential that results from charge separation across a permeable interface by diffusion down a concentration gradient [8].

From th same:
>We observed no significant change in the electrical potential difference between the xylem of the trunk region of the tree and soil with changing height or cardinal orientation of electrode
