# Spruce-Voltmeter
Arduino Project With Borrowed Ideas for Wilderness Data

Based on a project by Shahariar @ https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/PSoC_Rocks/arduino-negative-voltmeter-993902

Goal is to go into the Alaskan Wilderness and listen to Spruce trees, and borrow their electrons.

Needs:
* Integration of SD card function to save datapoint
* sample rate for voltmeter
* some fine ASCII art
* aref_ voltage measure on board w/ battery power
